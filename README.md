A Zygisk module which fixes "ctsProfileMatch" (SafetyNet) and "MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY" (Play Integrity). 1

To use this module you must have one of the following (latest versions):

- [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) with Zygisk enabled (and Enforce DenyList enabled if NOT also using [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases), for best results)
- [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) module installed
- [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) module installed

## About module

It injects a classes.dex file to modify fields in the android.os.Build class. Also, it creates a hook in the native code to modify system properties. These are spoofed only to Google Play Services' DroidGuard (SafetyNet/Play Integrity) service.

The purpose of the module is to avoid hardware attestation.

## About 'custom.pif.json' file

You can fill out the included template [example.pif.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/main/module/example.pif.json) from the module directory (/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix) then rename it to custom.pif.json to spoof custom values to the GMS unstable process. It will be used instead of any included pif.json (none included currently).

Note this is just a template with the current suggested defaults, but with this fork you can include as few or as many android.os.Build class fields and Android system properties as needed to pass DEVICE verdict now and in the future if the enforced checks by Play Integrity change.

As a general rule you can't use values from recent devices due to them only being allowed with full hardware backed attestation. See the Resources below for information and scripts to help find a working fingerprint.

Older formatted custom.pif.json files from cross-forks and previous releases will be automatically migrated to the latest format. Simply ensure the filename is custom.pif.json and place it in the module directory before upgrading.

A migration may also be performed manually with `sh migrate.sh` and custom.pif.json in the same directory, or from a file explorer app that supports script execution.

## About 'custom.app_replace.list' file

You can customize the included default [example.app_replace.list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/main/module/example.app_replace.list) from the module directory (/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix) then rename it to custom.app_replace.list to systemlessly replace any additional conflicting custom ROM spoof injection app paths to disable them.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure Google Play Services (com.google.android.gms) is NOT on the Magisk DenyList if Enforce DenyList is enabled since this interferes with the module; the module does prevent this using scripts but it only happens once during each reboot.

### Failing BASIC verdict

If you are failing basicIntegrity (SafetyNet) or MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY (Play Integrity) something is wrong in your setup. Recommended steps in order to find the problem:

- Disable all modules except this one
- Try a different (ideally known working) custom.pif.json

Note: Some modules which modify system (e.g. Xposed) can trigger DroidGuard detections, as can any which hook GMS processes (e.g. custom fonts).

### Failing DEVICE verdict (on KernelSU/APatch)

- Disable Zygisk Next
- Reboot
- Enable Zygisk Next
- Reboot again

### Failing DEVICE verdict (on custom kernel/ROM)

- Check the kernel release string with command `adb shell uname -r` or `uname -r`
- If it's on the [Known Banned Kernel List](https://xdaforums.com/t/module-play-integrity-fix-safetynet-fix.4607985/post-89308909) then inform your kernel developer/ROM maintainer to remove their branding for their next build
- You may also try a different custom kernel, or go back to the default kernel for your ROM, if available/possible

### Play Protect/Store Certification and Google Wallet Tap To Pay Setup Security Requirements

Follow these steps:

- Reflash the module in your root manager app
- Clear Google Wallet (com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel) and/or Google Pay (com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user) cache, if you have them installed
- Clear Google Play Store (com.android.vending) cache and data
- Clear Google Play Services (com.google.android.gms) cache and data, or, optionally skip clearing data and wait some time (~24h) for it to resolve on its own
- Reboot

Note: Clearing Google Play Services app ***data*** will then require you to reset any WearOS devices paired to your device.

### Read module logs

You can read module logs using one of these commands directly after boot:

`adb shell "logcat | grep 'PIF/'"` or `su -c "logcat | grep 'PIF/'"`

Add a "verboseLogs" entry with a value of "0", "1", "2", "3" or "100" to your custom.pif.json to enable higher logging levels; "100" will dump all Build fields, and all the system properties that DroidGuard is checking. Adding the entry can also be done using the migration script with the `sh migrate.sh --force --advanced` or `sh migrate.sh -f -a` command.

## Can this module pass MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY?

No.
